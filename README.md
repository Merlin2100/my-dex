# my-dex - Decentralized Exchange Example

`my-dex` is a comprehensive example project that walks you through the process of creating a decentralized exchange (DEX) with its own custom cryptocurrency. This project serves as a practical guide for developers looking to understand and implement key components of a DEX, including the smart contract logic and the frontend user interface.

## Introduction

The primary goal of `my-dex` is to provide a hands-on experience in developing a DEX, covering aspects such as token creation, the implementation of a decentralized exchange contract, and the development of a user-friendly frontend using React and Redux. Whether you are a beginner exploring blockchain development or an experienced developer diving into decentralized finance (DeFi), this project aims to be a valuable resource.

## Features

- **Custom Cryptocurrency Creation:** Walks you through the process of creating your own cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain.
